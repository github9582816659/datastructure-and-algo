Operations On Array:
--------------------

Arrays can do random access using the location (calculate from starting index & ith item need to search) & are cache friendliness ( as all itmes
are placed consecutively & when cpu tries to fetch data, it used to fetch data around which makes array as best fit for cache)

Insert : O(n)
Search : O(n) for unsorted array
         O(log n) for sorted array
Delete : O(n)

Search ith element : O(1)
Update ith element : O(1)

Insert at end : O(1)
Delete at end : O(1)
